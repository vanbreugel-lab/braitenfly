basic problem is the driver needs to be updated.

First, run the command 

lspci -nnk | grep 0280 -A3

to check what the driver version is, then you need to run some system updates and reinstall the driver with the following commands:


git clone https://github.com/HRex39/rtl8852be.git
cd rtl8852be
make
sudo make install

--> once this is done you can reboot and it should work! See the linked webpage above for dditional troubleshooting ideas if this doesnt solve the issue.  https://askubuntu.com/questions/1412450/network-driver-for-realtek-10ecb852
